# How to Export Files from Fork to Main Branch

## Option 1: Manual File Transfer
1. Download the key modified files from your fork
2. Upload those files to the main branch repository
3. Commit the changes to the main branch

## Option 2: Pull Request (GitHub/GitLab/etc.)
1. Push your fork's changes to your remote repository
2. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository
3. Once approved and merged, Netlify will automatically deploy the updates

## Key Files to Transfer
- `src/App.tsx` (with your fixes for the page 4 submission issue)
- `src/types.ts` (updated type definitions)
- Any other files you've modified

## Netlify Will Automatically:
- Detect the changes to the main branch
- Build and deploy the updated site
- Maintain all environment variables and settings
